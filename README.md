# Ops Online Support Website

This repository hosts the static website for Ops Online Support.

## Structure

- HTML pages in the root directory.
- Supporting assets live in `css/`, `js/`, and `images/`.

## Housekeeping

Unused backups and experiments previously stored in `not-used/` were removed to keep the codebase lean. Archived resources, if any, should be kept outside the main tree.
